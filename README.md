Would you like to be kept in a constant state of fear, not knowing when the next jump-scare might occur?
Then JUMP_SCARES_FOR_YOUR_WEBSITE.js is for you!

Ghost installation is easy. Simply upload the "haunt_your_website" folder in the same directory as the page you would like to see possessed. Once all files are uploaded to your server, begin the ritual of adding the following code to your page...

Right bellow the
```
<title> </title>
```
tags, paste the following:
```
<script src="haunt_your_website/ghost.js"></script>
```
Then overwrite your
```
<body>
```
tag with the following:
```
<body onload="ghost_init(true);">
```
So that immediate possession occurs after load.

*Note:* you may substitute the "true" argument for "false" if you wish to by-pass the bootup message. This way visitors receive no warning of the page's haunted nature.
